## Advent of COBOL

Advent of Code .. but in COBOL (those I can manage at least)

### 2022

##### [Day 1](./2022/day01.cob)

This is the first problem I tackled, and one that took many turns as I first wanted to store the data, then couldn't work out how.  Before working it out, then battling with weird data rules that meant numbers were put on the unexpected end of their volume - You can see this with the weird numbers shifting shenanigans that take place during the parsing of the file.  But in the end it worked out, even if this isn't perhaps the most efficient way to solve it, I learned a bit about how to manipulate the data.
